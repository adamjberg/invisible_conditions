Led by a team of post-secondary students who have experience with these conditions, sessions will focus on common challenges and stories of success. The vision for the Invisible Conditions Conference is to bring this usually private struggle into the light, and offer kindness and support to youth who fight it daily.</p><h3>MISSION STATEMENT</h3><ul><li>The Invisible Conditions Conference aims to…</li><li>Give youth a safe space to come together to connect, share stories and experiences, and create a supportive network.</li><li>Prepare, connect, and facilitate mentorship relationships between post-secondary students and youth.</li><li>Support the Mental Health and Wellbeing of youth with chronic conditions.</li></ul><h2>PILOT YEAR FOCUS</h2><p>In our pilot year, we would like to focus on youth with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD, e.g., Crohn’s and colitis). Canada has one of the highest rates of inflammatory bowel disease in the world, occurring in approximately 1 in 150 people. These conditions can be physically and emotionally painful, as well as embarrassing and isolating. This pilot year will help shape how we can support other individuals with invisible conditions, in particular those with rare and unique conditions that face similar challenges.</p></div></section><section id="more-info"><div class="container"><h2>Interested?</h2><p>Sign up for more info</p><form id="more-info-form" action="/api/more-info"><div class="form-group"><label>Email</label><input name="email" type="email" placeholder="Email"></div><div class="form-group"><label>I am interested in</label><select name="interest"><option value="attend">Attending</option><option value="mentor">Mentoring</option><option value="volunteer">Volunteering</option><option value="other">Other</option></select></div></form></div></section><section id="sponsors"><div class="container"><h3>Sponsors<table><tr><td><img src="img/gis.png"></td><td><img src="img/ubc.png"></td></tr></table></h3></div></section><section id="contact-us"><div class="container"><h2>Contact Us</h2><a href="mailto:contact@invisibleconditions.ca">contact@invisibleconditions.ca</a></div></section></body></html>
