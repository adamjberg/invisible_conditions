          p Invisible Conditions Conference (ICC) aims to bring teens and young adults with chronic health conditions together in a safe space to share their experiences and support each other. Individuals living with invisible conditions face challenges and barriers beyond their physical symptoms such as navigating relationships, developing identity, facing stigma, and coping with diagnoses. 
          p In our pilot year, we would like to invite those living with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; e.g., Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis) to the conference. This focus will help shape how we can support other individuals with invisible conditions, in particular those with rare and unique conditions that face similar challenges.
