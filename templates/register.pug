        p Thank you for your interest in becoming a mentor for the Invisible Conditions Conference. To be a mentor you must be available for the day of the conference, Saturday, June 24th, 2017 to be held at the UBC Vancouver campus in Ponderosa Commons. You must also be available for a training session that will take place in mid-May and complete a criminal record check.  Other than this, the time you commit to this project is up to you! How and how often mentors and mentees stay in touch (i.e. emails, texts, in person meetups) will be up to each mentor-mentee pair.
        p To participate as a mentor, please answer the following questions and complete the mentor-mentee matching questionnaire. These questions are designed to help us tailor your experience as a mentor to optimize your benefits. Your answers will be kept confidential. 
        p Please note that at this time, during our pilot year, only UBC Students are eligible to be mentors.

How and how often mentors and mentees stay in touch (i.e. emails, texts, in person meetups) will be up to each mentor-mentee pair.
